# Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle Competition

Welcome to my submission for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition! This project aims to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The Spaceship Titanic competition is a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict the fate of passengers aboard the ill-fated Spaceship Titanic. The dataset includes various features such as passenger demographics, cabin information, and spending habits, which can be used to build predictive models.

## Technical Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones, such as extracting deck and side information from cabin numbers.
- **Data Transformation**: Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables.

### 2. Model Selection and Training
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the selected models.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzing the confusion matrix to understand the types of errors made by the model.

### 4. Submission
- **Prediction**: Generating predictions on the test dataset.
- **Submission File**: Creating a submission file in the required format for Kaggle.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques to solve a binary classification problem. The final model aims to achieve high accuracy and generalizability, contributing to the overall goal of the Kaggle competition.
